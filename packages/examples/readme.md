# Playground

To run this example, run `yarn start` in this folder.

This is an example playground. It contains a few simple, raw examples using statext.

- AsycState. An example on how to integrate React Suspense
- AuthState. Simulates a simple async action.
- CountState. The simplest example.

We'll add more examples in the future. If there's something you're wondering how to do with statext, open an issue and we'll try to make an example for that.
